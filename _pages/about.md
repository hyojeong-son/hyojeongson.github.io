👋 Hello! I'm Hyojeong Son, a 4th-year PhD student in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Washington, where I work with my advisor, Professor Christopher Hoffman. My research focuses on probability theory, particularly particle models such as sandpiles and activated random walks. Recently, I’ve been exploring stable matchings with correlated preferences. I’m passionate about expanding my understanding of probability and look forward to learning from new ideas and challenging problems.

I earned my Bachelor's degree from Stony Brook University and a Master's degree from Washington University in St. Louis.
