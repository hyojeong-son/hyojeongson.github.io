<!-- Bio Section -->
## Bio
Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Hyojeong Son, a 4th-year PhD student in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Washington, where I work with my advisor, Professor [Christopher Hoffman](http://sites.math.washington.edu/~hoffman/). Iâ€™m enthusiastic about probability theory, with a particular focus on particle models like sandpiles and activated random walks. I also enjoy exploring other areas of probability and have recently been working on stable matchings with correlated preferences. Iâ€™m eager to keep learning and growing through new ideas and interesting problems.

I earned my Bachelor's degree from Stony Brook University and a Master's degree from Washington University in St. Louis.
